#summary Example commands and tasks GoogleCL can do.

<wiki:toc/>

Also see the [Manual] and the [SystemRequirements].  Note that (only) the first time you use each service, you'll need to grant authorization from a web browser.

GoogleCL will do its best to figure out what you wanted without specific options being mentioned. In the descriptions that follow, any required options will be filled in by leftover command line arguments. For example, here is the description for the Blogger "tag" task:

Requires: title AND tags Optional: blog

So if you do not specify `--title` or `--tags`, either on the command line or with your configuration file, GoogleCL will read the first argument as the title, and the second as a comma-separated list of tags. That is,

{{{$ google blogger tag "My Post" "tag1, tag2, tag3"}}}

is equivalent to

{{{$ google blogger tag --title "My Post --tags "tag1, tag2, tag3"}}}

If you think something strange is going on, add the `--verbose` flag to the command, and you should see an output of what required fields were not specified with an option flag, and what the options were ultimately filled in with. Here's an example output from `blogger list`:

{{{missing_reqs: ['fields']
Option convert: True
Option delimiter: ,
Option fields: title,url-site        # Filled in from the config file
Option hostid: MY_HOST_ID
Option src: []
Option user: tom.h.miller
Option verbose: True}}}

There are also instances, (usually when listing or deleting events) where you want to specify more than one value for an argument. These should be picked up from the command line arguments semi-intelligently. For example:

{{{$ google calendar today Breakfast Lunch Dinner}}}

will decide that you're looking for events with titles that start with "Breakfast", or "Lunch", or "Dinner".

These examples use regular expressions (albeit very simple ones). GoogleCL will only accept expressions that work with the [http://docs.python.org/library/re.html Python re package]. Regular expressions are enabled by default, but you can disable them with the `regex` configuration option. See ConfigurationOptions.

The following examples omit the leading "google <service>"
=Blogger=
*Note:* `--blog` is required the first time you run a blogger task, unless you only have one blog. If you have more than one blog, and do not specify `--blog`, the blog that you entered the first time using GoogleCL will be used.

==delete==
Delete posts.

Requires: title Optional: blog

  * {{{delete bad_post really_bad\w*}}}
  * {{{delete --blog ".*" --title ".*fanfic.*"}}}

==list==
List posts.

Requires: fields AND delimiter Optional: blog, title, owner

  * {{{list name,author,url --blog ".*"}}}
  * {{{list --owner <Blogger Profile ID Number>}}}
  * {{{list --delimiter="|" --title wiki}}}

==post==
Post content to a blog.

Requires: src Optional: blog, title, tags, draft

  * {{{post --tags "GoogleCL, awesome" --title "Test Post" --src "I'm posting from the command line"}}}
  * {{{post blogpost.txt}}}
  * {{{post ~/old_posts/*.txt ~/new_posts/*.html}}}
  * {{{post --blog "Ye Olde Tech Blog" "Hark! Android 2.2 released." --tags "google, android" --draft}}}

==tag==
Label/tag posts in a blog.

Requires: title AND tags Optional: blog

See the [http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/wiki/Manual#Options Manual] for tag syntax

  * {{{tag "Chaffeur" "-confidential awesome"}}}
  * {{{tag --blog "Tagless" ".*" "--"}}}

=Calendar=
*Note:* if --cal is omitted, your primary/default calendar will be used.
*Note:* For `list` and `delete`, your ENTIRE CALENDAR will be retrieved. This can take a while. Use `--date` to restrict date ranges, and `--query` to match text in the event title or description. See the Manual for how to use `--date`.

==add==
Add events.

Requires: src Optional: cal

  * {{{add "Dinner party tomorrow at 6pm"}}}
  * {{{add --cal launch "Release .deb tomorrow" "Release .zip at 5"}}}

==delete==
Delete events.

Requires: (title OR query) Optional: date, cal

  * {{{delete "Lunch with that jerk"}}}
  * {{{delete --cal "tentative" --title ".*"}}}

==list==
List events.

Requires: fields AND delimiter Optional: title, query, date, cal

  * {{{list Breakfast Lunch Dinner --date 2010-10-14}}}

==today==
List events going on today. Essentially shorthand for `--date <today>,<tomorrow>` with the `list` task.

Requires: fields AND delimiter Optional: title, query, cal

  * {{{today --cal ".*"}}}
  * {{{today --fields name,where --delimiter " :: "}}}

=Contacts=
*Note:* `--title` is required for most of these. If you are prompted to enter a title, just hitting enter is equivalent to and faster than specifying ".*".

==add==
Add contacts.

Requires: src

*Note:* `src` can be a name,email pair, or a file that contains one name,email pair per line.

  * {{{add "J. Random Hacker, jrandom@example.com"}}}

==upload==
Upload a document.

*Note:* Users with a Google Apps Premium account can use an additional option: `--no-convert`. This will let you upload arbitrary filetypes to Docs, like you can through the web interface. Unfortunately, this is not enabled for regular users.

  * {{{create "CATS" ~/photos/theater/broadway/cats/*.png --tags lol}}}

==delete==
Delete photos or albums.

Requires: (title OR query)

*Note:* `--title` will match on album names, `--query` on photo tags and captions. If `--query` is specified, the objects being deleted will be photos that match the query value that are also in the album that matches `--title`.

  * {{{delete "Vacation 2010" -q "kind of boring"    # Delete photos in album "Vacation 2010" that have a tag or caption of "kind of boring"}}}

=Youtube=
*Note:* You must log on with your Google account, but the `--owner` option will only accept YouTube usernames.
*Note:* The devkey is provided for you. However, because of the nature of the key, it may become invalid in the future, and in that case you will have to supply your own. `--devkey` will also take the name of a file where the devkey is stored.
